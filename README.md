Hi all! My name is Eric Hanson and I'm an aspiring web developer! 

I currently work as the head of the Quality Control Department at Morse Watchmans. We make electronic key security systems, and my job is to handle all of our repairs, RMAs, printed circuit board testing, among many other things. While I do enjoy many aspects of my job,
I feel like taking the leap into programming offers much in the way of job-marketability and more access to remote work positions. 

I have previous experience learning Java and Python in university, but now I am working my way through the TripleTen bootcamp to learn: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I love the program so far and am escited to learn more.
My repository is mostly, at this nascient point, coding projects for said bootcamp, along with some side projects I've tinkered with. Much much more to come!
